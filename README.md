# Color Palette Generator

Color Palette Generator is a simple web page that allows you to generate color palettes. It displays 10 color cards, each showing a color and its corresponding hex code. By clicking the "Refresh Palette" button, the hex codes and colors of all the cards are changed.

## Features

- Generate color palettes with hex codes
- Copy hex codes to clipboard by clicking on them
- Temporary "Copied" message appears when a hex code is copied
- Lock individual color cards to prevent them from changing when refreshing the palette

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ivansdk/color_palette_generator.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

3. Click the "Refresh Palette" button to generate a new set of colors.

4. To copy a hex code to the clipboard, simply click on it. A "Copied" message will appear briefly.

5. To lock a color card, click on the color area of the card. A lock icon will appear, indicating that the card's color will remain unchanged when refreshing the palette. Clicking on the color area again will remove the lock.
